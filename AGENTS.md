# spacemap - AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

**spacemap** is a native macOS utility that visualizes yabai workspaces in a floating 2D grid overlay. Think of it as a "mission control" for your tiling window manager that doesn't require SIP to be disabled.

### What It Does
- Shows a HUD overlay (toggle with hotkey) displaying your yabai desktops in a configurable grid
- Live-updates as you switch spaces via yabai
- Lets you click cells to jump to spaces
- Supports three display styles: colored rectangles, app icons, or thumbnails (ScreenCaptureKit)
- Window drag-and-drop between cells (drag a window onto a cell to move it)
- Menubar icon for manual show/hide (can be hidden)

## Quick Reference for Agents
- **Entry point**: `Sources/spacemap/App.swift` – sets up menubar, hotkey monitor, socket listener.
- **HUD controller**: `Sources/spacemap/HUDWindowController.swift` – manages NSPanel, show/hide, auto-hide timer, state refresh.
- **UI**: `GridView.swift` (container) + `CellView.swift` (per-cell rendering).
- **Data**: `YabaiClient.swift` – shells out to `/opt/homebrew/bin/yabai` for spaces/windows; `ConfigReader.swift` – reads `~/.config/spacemap/config`.
- **Hotkey**: `HotkeyMonitor.swift` – global CGEventTap for toggle.
- **Drag‑and‑drop**: `WindowDragHandler.swift` – second CGEventTap for window drag detection.
- **Signals**: `SocketListener.swift` – Unix domain socket for yabai `space_changed` events.
- **Models**: `Models.swift` – data structs (GridConfig, YabaiSpace, etc.).
- **Settings**: `SettingsView.swift` + `SettingsWindowController.swift` – live‑save config UI.
- **Thumbnails**: `ThumbnailCache.swift` – ScreenCaptureKit capture, per-space caching (macOS 14+).
- **Build**: Use `make run` to build, install, launch. `make dev1`/`make dev2` for dev cycle.
- **Config**: Stored at `~/.config/spacemap/config`; reloads on HUD open (except HOTKEY needs restart).
- **Permissions**: Requires Accessibility permission (prompted on first launch). Screen Recording permission required for thumbnail cell style.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Language:** Swift 5.9, targeting macOS 13+
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI embedded in AppKit (NSHostingView)
- **Build System:** Swift Package Manager (Package.swift)
- **Dependencies:** ZERO external dependencies
- **System Integration:** Low-level macOS APIs (CoreGraphics, AppKit), yabai CLI calls, Unix domain sockets, CGEventTaps

```

### Key Data Flow

1. **App launches** → `App.swift` sets up menubar, hotkey monitor, and socket listener
2. **Hotkey pressed** → `HUDWindowController.show()` is called
3. **Show fetches data** → `YabaiClient.querySpaces()` / `queryWindows()` (shells to `/opt/homebrew/bin/yabai`)
4. **Builds state** → `YabaiClient.buildGridState()` assembles `GridState` with config
5. **Renders grid** → SwiftUI `GridView` → `CellView` for each cell
6. **Live updates** → yabai signal triggers → socket message → `HUDWindowController.refresh()`
7. **Drag-and-drop** → `WindowDragHandler` uses CGEventTap to track mouse, yabai to move window

### External Dependencies
- **yabai** (installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/yabai`) - tiling window manager
- **skhd** (installed at `/opt/homebrew/bin/skhd`) - hotkey daemon, configured for 2D grid navigation

### Configuration
Reads from `~/.config/spacemap/config` on every HUD open (no restart needed):
```bash
GRID_COLS=8              # Grid columns
GRID_ROWS=2              # Grid rows
CELL_STYLE=rects         # rects | icons | thumbnails
HOTKEY=ctrl+pgdn         # Toggle hotkey (requires restart)
SOCKET_HEALTH_INTERVAL=60  # Socket health check interval (seconds)
```

## Important Technical Details

### CGEventTap (Not NSEvent)
Uses `CGEvent.tapCreate` at `cgSessionEventTap` / `headInsertEventTap` for global hotkey capture. This requires Accessibility permissions.

### Binary Running vs App Bundle
macOS grants Accessibility to the `.app` bundle, not the raw binary. Running the binary directly will fail the trust check. Always use `make run` or `open /Applications/spacemap.app`.

### Permission Revocation on Reinstall
Rebuilding and reinstalling revokes Accessibility permissions because the binary hash changes. Use the `make dev1` / `make dev2` workflow.

### App Activation Policy
`NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.prohibited)` means the app never appears in the dock or Cmd+Tab switcher. It runs purely as a background utility.

### yabai Signal Integration
When the HUD is visible, yabai sends a signal to a Unix domain socket on `space_changed`. This triggers HUD refresh for live updates without polling.

### Window Drag Detection
A second CGEventTap (listenOnly, tailAppend) monitors mouse drag events to detect when the user drags an actual window over the HUD. It correlates the mouse position against cell hit-rectangles and uses the frontmost application to identify which window is being dragged.

### Cell Styles
- **rects:** Scales real window geometry to 80x50 cell, colored by app name hash
- **icons:** App icons at window position; app strip at bottom (controlled by `SHOW_ICON_STRIP`)
- **thumbnails:** ScreenCaptureKit display capture per cell (requires macOS 14+, Screen Recording permission)

## Development Workflow

### Build Commands
```bash
make build       # swift build -c release
make app         # Build and assemble .app bundle
make install     # Install to /Applications
make run         # Install and launch
make dev1        # Uninstall (then remove Accessibility in System Settings)
make dev2        # Reinstall, relaunch, re-grant permissions
make config      # Create default config
make permissions # Show permission fix instructions
make clean       # Remove build artifacts
make archive     # Build signed archive for release
```

### Testing Changes
1. `make dev1` (uninstalls app)
2. Remove spacemap from System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility
3. Make code changes
4. `make dev2` (builds, installs, launches)
5. Grant permission when prompted

## Known Limitations / Gotchas

1. **yabai path hardcoded:** `/opt/homebrew/bin/yabai` - doesn't support other install locations (no PATH search)
2. **Homebrew-specific:** Brew formula only, no other package managers
3. **SwiftUI performance:** Each HUD open creates a new NSHostingView. The state is cached during a drag, but the view is recreated.
4. **Icon strip flicker:** On space change, `CellView` rerenders and re-fetches icons via `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)` which is potentially expensive
5. **Drag resolution:** Window drag detection uses frontmost app name matching, which can be ambiguous for multi-window apps. Falls back to click proximity.
6. **No tests:** There are zero unit tests
7. **Socket health check:** Periodic `fcntl(fd, F_GETFD)` check + file existence check. Restarts on failure.

## Potential Extension Points

### Appearance
- Custom cell colors, backgrounds, or opacity
- Custom fonts/sizes for space numbers
- Rounded corners, borders, shadow customization
- Animations for cell focus/hover

### Behavior
- Customizable cell size (currently hardcoded 80x50)
- Grid gap/padding config
- Multi-monitor awareness (spaces per display)

### Features
- Show window titles on hover
- Keyboard navigation within HUD (arrows + enter)
- Pin HUD to always show (like a dashboard)
- Window thumbnail previews instead of rectangles
- Filter/hide specific apps from the grid

### Integration
- Support for other window managers besides yabai ( Parallel to yabai? Or macOS native Spaces? )
- Scripting / CLI interface to trigger HUD from scripts
- Notifications / system alerts
- Better multi-monitor support

### Build / Dev
- Add unit tests (XCTest)
- Linting / formatting (SwiftFormat)
- CI/CD for automated builds/releases
- Homebrew formula improvements

## Questions

1. **Why only `/opt/homebrew/bin/yabai`?** What about Intel Macs with `/usr/local/bin/yabai` or non-brew installs?
2. **Electron app?** The screenshot in the README shows what looks like an electron-style window. Is there a web/JS component, or is this pure Swift? (It is pure Swift with SwiftUI, the screenshot is just the HUD).
3. **i18n?** No localization is present. Are there plans for it?
4. **Accessibility of the config?** The config file uses a simple key=value format, but there's no validation or schema. Would a JSON or YAML config be better?
5. **Hotkey parsing limitations?** The hotkey parser only supports a subset of keys (see `ConfigReader.keyCodeFor`). Keys like F13-F20, media keys, etc., are not supported. Is this by design?
6. **The `yabaiPath` is static in `YabaiClient`:** Should it be configurable or auto-discovered?
